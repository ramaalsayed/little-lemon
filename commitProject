Step 1: Add your changes as another commit
Save all your updates in your local project. Make sure to save each file individually or click the File > Save All command in VS Code's top-level menu.

Once that's done, open the built-in terminal and run the git add --all command, followed by the git commit -m "Some commit message of your choice goes here" command.

Tip: Make sure that the commit message is sensical, such as Simplify the boilerplate app.

Step 2: Push your changes to your remote origin (GitHub)
Now that you have saved and committed the changes, you can push them to GitHub.

Use the git push command to push the saved and committed changes to GitHub.

Step 3: Inspect the updates on GitHub
Open your browser and navigate to GitHub.

Make sure you're logged in.

Locate your project's repository.

Ensure that your most recently pushed commit is displayed.

Tip: Sometimes it takes a few seconds for GitHub to update with your changes. Refreshing the GitHub web application might help show the updates.
